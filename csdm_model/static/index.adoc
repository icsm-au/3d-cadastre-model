= 3D Cadastral Survey Data Model

== 2023 Standard - Rebuild

This is the index page of the 2023 rebuild of the 3D Cadastral Survey Data Model (3D CSDM).

This work builds on the 2022 documented form of the model that contains both model components and requirements. It has been archived online at:

* https://icsm-au.github.io/3d-csdm-design/2022/spec.html[https://linked.data.gov.au/def/csdm/2022]

*A new build on a pre-release version of pyLODE supporting the documentation of profiles is at:*

* https://icsm-au.github.io/3d-csdm/docs 游릭
* https://icsm-au.github.io/3d-csdm/docs/icsm-profile 游릭
* https://icsm-au.github.io/3d-csdm/docs/nz-profile 游릭
* https://icsm-au.github.io/3d-csdm/docs/wa-profile 游릭

Below are links to _in development_ documented forms of the current version of this model using pyLODE's OntPub profile.
